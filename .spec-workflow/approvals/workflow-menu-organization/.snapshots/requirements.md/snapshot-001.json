The capability should feel native to modern SaaS tools, emphasizing ease, clarity, and trust that personalizations persist.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nSupports the menu’s goal of making automations discoverable and controllable by individual users. Personalized ordering keeps high-value workflows within immediate reach, while a dedicated hide surface prevents noise without permanently removing access to authored automations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1 — Visual Drag-and-Drop Reordering\n\n**User Story:** As a workflow-heavy operator, I want to drag workflows into my preferred order so that my most-used automations stay at the top of the Workflows tab.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user hovers over a workflow item THEN the UI SHALL reveal a drag handle affordance without shifting surrounding content.\n2. WHEN a user drags a workflow via the handle THEN the list SHALL display a live drop indicator and reflow remaining items without jank at 60fps targets on modern hardware.\n3. WHEN a user drops a workflow into a new position THEN the menu SHALL persist the new order in local storage and immediately reflect the updated ordering across all open menu instances.\n4. IF a user navigates away or reloads the page THEN the previously saved order SHALL rehydrate before the first render of the Workflows tab.\n\n### Requirement 2 — Quick Hide From Primary List\n\n**User Story:** As a user who only runs a subset of workflows on a page, I want to hide the ones I rarely use so that the Workflows tab stays focused and scannable.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user activates the hide control on a workflow THEN the item SHALL animate out of the main list and confirm it moved to Hidden workflows via toast or inline confirmation.\n2. IF a workflow is hidden THEN it SHALL not appear in auto-run or repeat toggles in the primary list, but its automation metadata SHALL remain intact.\n3. WHEN a hidden workflow becomes auto-run enabled through existing preferences THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to unhide or confirm keeping it hidden before activating auto-run.\n\n### Requirement 3 — Discoverable Hidden Workflows Hub\n\n**User Story:** As a cautious user, I want hidden workflows collected in a modern, easy-to-browse space so that I can quickly review, search, and unhide them when needed.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN hidden workflows exist THEN the menu SHALL surface a \"Hidden\" tab (or equivalent pill) with a badge showing the hidden count.\n2. WHEN a user opens the Hidden space THEN workflows SHALL render as cards or rows with compact metadata, search/filter controls, and a single-click unhide action.\n3. IF no workflows are hidden THEN the Hidden space SHALL collapse into a subtle affordance (e.g., ghost badge) and SHALL describe how to hide workflows.\n4. WHEN a user unhides a workflow from the Hidden space THEN it SHALL return to the main list in its previous relative ordering anchor or appended to the bottom if no prior position exists.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- Persist ordering and hidden-state data through existing `Store` primitives without coupling reordering logic to workflow execution.\n- Encapsulate drag-and-drop behaviors in reusable utilities so other tabs can adopt the interaction later.\n- Ensure UI components expose clear interfaces for state updates to avoid prop drilling across the Shadow DOM boundaries.\n\n### Performance\n- Maintain interactive drag at target 60fps on Chrome/Edge, with frame drops not exceeding 16ms spikes during reorder.\n- Limit persistence writes to debounce within 250ms of drop events to avoid storage thrashing.\n\n### Security\n- Do not expose workflow metadata beyond the existing Shadow DOM; prevent drag events from leaking to the host page.\n- Respect the same origin storage rules, avoiding cross-origin requests or new permissions.\n\n### Reliability\n- Persist ordering and hidden states across browser restarts using current storage (e.g., GM_* APIs).\n- Ensure fallback rendering retains default ordering when stored data is corrupted or missing.\n\n### Usability\n- Provide keyboard support for moving workflows up/down and toggling hide/unhide without requiring pointer input.\n- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast and focus requirements for new affordances, including drag handles and Hidden tab indicators.\n",
